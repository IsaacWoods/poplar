//! This module contains functions that help us validate the inputs to system calls that try to
//! make sure userspace can't crash or exploit the kernel in any way. For example, if we take an
//! address from userspace, we should make sure it's mapped (so we don't page-fault) and an address
//! that userspace could ordinarily access itself (otherwise, we could leak information to a
//! userspace task that it shouldn't be able to access).

         *      write, as the data is read and written to from both the kernel and userspace.
         *    - Using `ptr::write_volatile(x, ...)` instead of `*x = ...` makes sure we don't attempt to drop
         *      the existing value, which could read uninitialized memory.

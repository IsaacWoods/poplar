# Code Of Conduct
Some OS development communities have proven themselves to be some of the most toxic in software development. I vehemently oppose that:
* Developers being nice to each other somehow decreases the quality of software
* Not having a code of conduct somehow magically leads to "software egalitarianism", and so one isn't needed
* Software is developed in a vacuum and people's feelings never come into account

Having thick skin should not be a requirement for contributing to open-source projects, and so this document sets out expectations for all discussion and engagement within the Pebble project. If you can not
abide by these expectations, your contributions are not welcome, regardless of their technical worth.

### Expectations
* Pebble aims to provide a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic. As a contributor, you must do your bit to maintain this environment.
* Be kind and courteous
* Rarely in OS development is there a right answer - respect that people may have differences in opinion, and that all implementations have trade-offs
* Keep in mind that, even if you do not see the value in a contribution, that someone else has put time and effort into it
* Keep critique technical

### Examples of unwelcome behaviour
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing of others' private information, such as physical or electronic address, without explicit permission (any form of doxxing)
* Spamming, flaming, baiting, or otherwise attention-seeking behaviour
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Enforcement
Pebble's maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, wiki edits, issues, or any other contributions that do not align with this code of conduct, or to temporarily or permanently
ban any contributor for breaking these expectations, or for any other behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. They also have the right to expand this code of conduct at
any time, should the community grow - the new changes come into effect from the point the change is committed to `master`.

### Scope
This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

**Pebble is still early in development.**

Pebble is a microkernel and userspace written in Rust, with a focus on safety and simplicity. It is designed to be simple to understand, extend, and develop for. Pebble does not aim for POSIX compliance.
The best way to learn about Pebble is to read [the book](https://isaacwoods.github.io/pebble/book/). [The website](https://isaacwoods.github.io/pebble) also hosts other useful resources, such as `rustdoc`-generated
documentation of the components.
